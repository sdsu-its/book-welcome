# Introduction

Track visitors and their primary objective for their visit to your office, co-working space, workshop, or other open space. After their visit, poll guests with tailored survey implements to allow for continuous improvement of your space and/or services. Welcome also allows for tracking of hourly employees, like you might find at a University Space.
